# sparrow
A simple and lightweight teamspeak query wrapper written in C# to rule them all.

# Installation / Usage

There's currently no NuGet package, maybe one far day.

# State of the AAAARRRT
I currently can't do that much. I can login into the telnet interface and select the virtual teamspeak server, sometimes, on a 
good day. Seems to depend on a mixture of the current time and the mass of the sun subtracted from my lines of code. Multiply 
that with your own age and maybe it will 0 - Then it will work. Wait, what?
